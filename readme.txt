== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use the plugin without Elementor Page Builder? =

No. You cannot use without Elementor since it's an addon for Elementor.

= Do I need Elementor Pro? =

No – it is designed for use with Elementor regardless of free or pro version.

= Does it work with any theme? =

Yes! It will work with any theme where Elementor is installed.

= How do I switch from Zeus to Amadeus? =

**Backup your site first.**

Leave Zeus installed, and activate Amadeus.

Amadeus will run a database check and replace as many Zeus elements and settings as it can find, with Amadeus settings.

Check the Plugins list – if, in the Amadeus row, a `Delete Zeus Elementor` link appears, click it to finish removing Zeus from your site. Then, check each page of Amadeus settings to make sure your settings remain as you'd like. We'd also recommend checking any pages the widgets are already used in, to ensure the element has carried through correctly.
